Examples of using `react-testing-library` and `Jest` to:

- Test rendering react components
- Test prop updates with `rerender`
- Test event handlers with `fireEvent`
- Assert that something is not rendered
- Test accessibility with `jest-axe`
- Mock http requests with `jest.mock`
- Mock `react-transition-group` with `jest.mock`
- Test `componentDidCatch` handler error boundaries
- Setup shared config for tests with `src/setupTests`
- Using TDD to create a form, mock API call, handle error state
- Mock `react-router` `Redirect`
- Test drive assertions with dates
- Use generated data in tests using `test-data-bot`
- Share code between tests with custom render
- Test components that use `react-router` with `createMemoryHistory`
- Test the NoMatch route
- Test redux connected components with initialized state
- Test "render props" components
- Test portal components
- Test unmounting components and avoiding memory leaks
